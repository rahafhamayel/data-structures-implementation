# data-structures-implementation
Implementations of basic data structures using java
ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ Completed Structures

âœ… Implemented and tested:

- [x] Dynamic Array  
- [x] Singly Linked List  
- [x] Stack (using Array)  
- [x] Stack (using Linked List)  




- **`arrays/`**: Contains custom implementation of dynamic arrays from scratch without using Java's built-in `ArrayList`.
- **`linkedlists/`**: Includes classic singly linked list, node class, and a stack built on top of a linked list structure.
- **`stacks/`**: Holds array-based stack implementation with capacity handling and common stack operations.

Each `.java` file is:
- Independently runnable with a `main()` method for testing
- Fully documented with inline comments
- Built for clarity and educational purpose

Future folders (queues, trees, graphs, etc.) will follow the same structure for consistency.
